# An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Applications (Feller)

## Dissertation Alignment Context
The dissertation proposal uses a three-stage longitudinal pipeline: critical-range rectification of lagged signals into {-1,+1} indicators, L1-regularized logistic feature-and-lag selection, and anytime rule compression that converts sparse coefficients into compact m-of-K rules.

## Outline Summary of the Paper
1. **Scope and purpose:** The work builds a rigorous foundation for probability as a modeling language for uncertainty, balancing formal derivations with applied examples.
2. **Core probabilistic framework:** It develops sample spaces, events, probability measures, and combinatorial counting tools used to compute exact probabilities.
3. **Conditional reasoning:** A substantial portion treats conditional probability, Bayes-style updating, and independence structures that govern multivariable uncertainty.
4. **Classical discrete models:** The text develops Bernoulli, binomial, hypergeometric, geometric, and Poisson-type settings as canonical models for repeated trials and rare events.
5. **Random variables and distributions:** It formalizes distribution functions, moments, transforms/generating-function techniques, and algebra of random variables.
6. **Approximation and asymptotics:** It presents major limit ideas linking finite-sample models to tractable approximations, including law-of-large-numbers and normal-approximation logic.
7. **Sums and fluctuations:** The book analyzes aggregate behavior of random quantities and error fluctuations, emphasizing when Gaussian approximations are reliable.
8. **Dependence through time:** It treats recurring-event and random-walk style phenomena to illustrate temporal dependence and long-run behavior.
9. **Methodological style:** Results are developed via exact arguments first, then interpreted probabilistically, giving a template for proving and applying inference claims.
10. **Practical takeaway:** The text functions as a foundational reference for constructing assumptions, proving probabilistic lemmas, and justifying uncertainty statements in later modeling work.
