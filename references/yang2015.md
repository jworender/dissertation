# A Fast Unified Algorithm for Solving Group-Lasso Penalized Learning Problems (Yang and Zou, 2015)

## Dissertation Alignment Context
The dissertation proposal uses a three-stage longitudinal pipeline: critical-range rectification of lagged signals into {-1,+1} indicators, L1-regularized logistic feature-and-lag selection, and anytime rule compression that converts sparse coefficients into compact m-of-K rules.

## Outline Summary of the Paper
1. **Problem and motivation (Section 1):** The paper addresses efficient optimization for group-lasso penalized learning problems, especially when predictors are grouped and design matrices are not group-wise orthonormal.
2. **Unified objective setup (Section 2.1):** It formulates a general class of models as empirical loss plus weighted group-L2 penalties, covering regression and classification settings under one template.
3. **Quadratic-majorization condition (Section 2.2):** A QM condition is introduced to guarantee a usable quadratic upper bound on the loss, with a lemma giving practical sufficient conditions.
4. **Supported loss families (Section 2.2):** The paper verifies the QM condition for common losses including least squares, logistic loss, squared hinge loss, and Huberized hinge loss.
5. **Core algorithm derivation (Section 3.1):** It develops the groupwise-majorization-descent (GMD) algorithm, combining block updates with MM-style majorization to produce closed-form group shrinkage updates.
6. **Convergence and update mechanics (Section 3.1):** The method uses cyclic group updates and monotone objective descent under the majorization framework, yielding a stable iterative solver.
7. **Implementation accelerations (Section 3.2):** Practical speedups include warm starts along the lambda path, strong-rule screening, active-set cycling, and efficient gradient updates.
8. **Simulation runtime study (Section 4.1):** Timing experiments show large computational gains for `gglasso` relative to contemporaneous implementations (`grplasso` and `SLEP`) across model types.
9. **Numerical-quality and real-data results (Sections 4.2-4.3):** KKT checks and benchmark analyses indicate competitive or better solution quality with substantial runtime reductions on multiple real datasets.
10. **Conclusions and software impact (Section 5 and Supplementary Materials):** The paper positions GMD as a fast, unified group-lasso solver and provides a public implementation in the R package `gglasso`.

## Relevance to the Dissertation
A Fast Unified Algorithm for Solving Group-Lasso Penalized Learning Problems (Yang and Zou, 2015) is directly relevant because it offers a sparse-selection strategy that competes with the proposal's rectification-first approach under multicollinearity.

## Elements from This Paper to Use in the Dissertation
1. Include this method as an explicit baseline on both raw lag-expanded and rectified features.
2. Track support stability, false positives, and lag attribution quality, not only AUC/F1.
3. Reuse discussion around stat, comput, fast to motivate when penalty-only methods are sufficient.
4. Compare runtime and memory against the rectification + L1 + anytime-rule pipeline.

## Competitive Method Assessment
This paper describes a genuine competing method family. Relative to the dissertation pipeline, it can fall short when raw lag-expanded correlation is so high that support selection remains unstable or when explicit threshold/rule semantics are required. It can excel when linear signal is strong, penalty tuning is mature, and compact logical rules are not the primary requirement.

- Chapter: `Introduction`; Section: `Thesis Organization`; Line: `Chapters/01_introduction.tex:45`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that Following this introduction, the dissertation is organized as follows. The background chapter formalizes longitudinal feature-learning assumptions, sparse regularization foundations, and interpretability criteria, and then positions related methods in grouped, ordered, and dependence-aware selection . The methodology chapter presents the rectification algorithm, sparse fitting procedure, and anytime rule-compression mechanism in unified notation, including implementation details needed for reproducibility.
- Chapter: `Background`; Section: `Longitudinal lag expansion and structured sparsity`; Line: `Chapters/02_background.tex:24`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that Additional group-penalized optimization work improves runtime and practical convergence for non-orthonormal designs, making structured sparse models more usable in real pipelines . These methods are important comparators for this work: they preserve the original numeric representation and optimize increasingly sophisticated penalties, whereas the proposed pipeline changes representation first and then applies sparse selection.
- Chapter: `Background`; Section: `Competing approaches`; Line: `Chapters/02_background.tex:36`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that item Group and structured sparsity methods impose constraints on coefficients, such as group-wise inclusion or ordered lag decay; they often improve stability but generally do not alter the raw input dependence structure.
- Chapter: `Related Work`; Section: `Group, Block, and Ordered Sparsity`; Line: `Chapters/03_relatedwork.tex:31`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that Subsequent work extended grouped sparsity to logistic settings and improved practical optimization. Group lasso for logistic regression, blockwise sparse regression, and unified majorization-descent solvers significantly improved feasibility for high-dimensional non-orthonormal designs . These methods remain strong comparators because they encode structural assumptions directly in the objective while retaining convexity in many cases.
- Chapter: `Preliminary Studies and Evidence to Date for RQ1`; Section: `Comparison to competing feature-selection baselines`; Line: `Chapters/05_rq1.tex:53`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that Preliminary RQ1 evidence also includes comparisons with methods intended to address redundancy or grouped dependence through different mechanisms. Group and block-structured sparse families remain important comparators because they are explicitly designed for correlated predictor settings . In these early studies, however, representation-level rectification combined with standard lasso often provides clearer lag attribution in threshold-triggered synthetic settings.
- Chapter: `Future Work`; Section: `Workstream A: RQ1 Empirical Strengthening > A2. Baseline expansion under multicollinearity`; Line: `Chapters/88_futurework.tex:37`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that item Grouped-penalty baselines.
- Chapter: `Conclusion`; Section: `Positioning Relative to Prior Work`; Line: `Chapters/89_conclusion.tex:51`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that This work extends, rather than replaces, prior sparse and interpretable modeling literature. Relative to classical L1 and elastic-net families , the main difference is intervention point: representation is modified before sparse optimization. Relative to grouped and ordered penalties , this work emphasizes threshold logic and lag-attribution clarity in a longitudinal context. Relative to direct rule-learning approaches , it uses sparse convex fitting as a scalable front end and performs structured rule simplification afterward.
