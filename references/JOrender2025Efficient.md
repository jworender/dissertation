# Efficient Longitudinal Feature Selection via Binarized Transformation: Theory and Case Studies (Orender et al., 2025)

## Dissertation Alignment Context
The dissertation proposal uses a three-stage longitudinal pipeline: critical-range rectification of lagged signals into {-1,+1} indicators, L1-regularized logistic feature-and-lag selection, and anytime rule compression that converts sparse coefficients into compact m-of-K rules.

## Outline Summary of the Paper
1. **Problem and motivation (Section I):** The paper addresses sparse feature selection in high-dimensional longitudinal data where lagged threshold behavior and strong multicollinearity make raw LASSO supports unstable and hard to interpret.
2. **Central hypothesis and scope (Sections I and II):** It argues that a binarization-first preprocessing step can improve support recovery by contracting correlations, while explicitly limiting theoretical claims to a proof-of-concept (zero-threshold arcsin setting) rather than universal nonzero-threshold guarantees.
3. **Contributions and positioning (Section I-A/B):** The paper contributes theory, an efficient critical-range binarization pipeline, and case-study evidence, positioning the method as model-agnostic preprocessing complementary to penalty-design approaches (group/weighted/structured LASSO variants).
4. **Background and IC framing (Section II):** It formalizes L1-regularized fitting and the irrepresentable condition (IC), then links binarization to smaller off-support correlations and improved Gram-matrix conditioning as the mechanism for better support selection.
5. **Method specification (Section III):** The approach computes per-feature critical ranges from event rows, maps values inside range to +1 and outside to -1, preserves lag-expanded feature identity, and fits L1-logistic with cross-validated regularization.
6. **Algorithmic and implementation details (Section III-A to III-E):** Algorithm 1 defines training-only range estimation to prevent leakage, notes robust quantiles for outlier brittleness, and reports linear-time transform complexity with straightforward per-feature parallelization.
7. **Theoretical development (Section IV):** A sequence of lemmas and a main theorem show that in the PoC regime, arcsin-based correlation contraction yields tighter inverse-Gram and IC-related bounds, increasing the probability that a standard sufficient IC condition is satisfied.
8. **Empirical results (Section V):** Synthetic and HAI ICS experiments show improved sparsity, lag fidelity, and fewer false positives with transformed features; HAI metrics (ACC/AUC/F1/Youden's J) are notably stronger than untransformed baselines.
9. **Cross-dataset behavior (Section V-C/D):** Additional datasets indicate benefits are context dependent: transformed models often gain interpretability and selection fidelity, while raw metrics can favor untransformed features in regimes less aligned with threshold-and-lag structure.
10. **Limitations and outlook (Sections VI and VII):** The paper highlights limits of linear downstream models, PoC-theory assumptions, and negative-correlation edge cases, then proposes future work on nonzero-threshold theory, scalable implementations, and broader longitudinal applications.

- Chapter: `Research Questions`; Section: `Why RQ1 matters`; Line: `Chapters/04_resquestions.tex:22`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that This question is also important for continuity with prior publications in the dissertation line. Earlier work introduced and refined rectification-first sparse longitudinal modeling and reported promising empirical behavior across synthetic and real datasets . This work must now determine whether those improvements are robust across broader benchmark designs, stronger baselines, and stricter attribution-oriented criteria.
- Chapter: `Research Questions`; Section: `Why RQ2 matters`; Line: `Chapters/04_resquestions.tex:28`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that At a high level, the motivating hypothesis is that rectification can contract harmful dependence structure in ways that improve sparse-support conditions related to IC-style reasoning . Prior proof-of-concept analysis in this line supports this direction under explicit assumptions, but does not yet establish universal guarantees across all threshold settings and dependence regimes . RQ2 is therefore critical: it separates durable methodological insight from dataset-specific heuristic success.
- Chapter: `Research Questions`; Section: `Cross-RQ Evaluation Priorities`; Line: `Chapters/04_resquestions.tex:44`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that item Predictive discrimination: metrics such as AUC and Youden's J at operational thresholds, with context-dependent interpretation across datasets.
- Chapter: `Research Questions`; Section: `Significance of the Chapter`; Line: `Chapters/04_resquestions.tex:55`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that This chapter establishes the scope and rationale of the research program before technical detail. RQ1 asks whether the approach works empirically in the intended problem class. RQ2 asks whether the observed behavior is theoretically credible and generalizable. RQ3 asks whether the resulting models are usable in real decision workflows. Taken together, the three questions define the dissertation's central claim that rectification-first sparse longitudinal learning, followed by anytime rule compression, can provide a practical middle ground between unstable raw sparse fitting and computationally heavy direct rule search.
- Chapter: `Preliminary Studies and Evidence to Date for RQ1`; Section: `Chapter context (no explicit section)`; Line: `Chapters/05_rq1.tex:7`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that The evidence reported to date is anchored in prior work from the same method lineage, beginning with the rectification-first lasso logic framework and extending to later theory-backed case studies . Across studies, the central empirical pattern is consistent: when the data generating process has threshold-and-lag structure, rectification tends to improve support concentration, lag localization, and sparse-model usability under multicollinearity pressure.
- Chapter: `Preliminary Studies and Evidence to Date for RQ1`; Section: `Synthetic evidence with known ground truth`; Line: `Chapters/05_rq1.tex:49`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that Figure fig:synth_tvsu provides qualitative support for the same conclusion: rectification yields nonzero coefficients that align more closely with true causal lags, while untransformed fitting produces noisier support spread. This behavior is consistent with the rectification rationale described in prior publications, where binarized critical-range mapping is expected to reduce harmful correlation effects before sparse optimization.
- Chapter: `Preliminary Studies and Evidence to Date for RQ1`; Section: `Real-world evidence and interpretability tradeoffs`; Line: `Chapters/05_rq1.tex:93`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that Cross-dataset behavior is not uniform. In the UNICEF case, untransformed models can achieve stronger raw discrimination metrics while transformed models remain substantially sparser and easier to interpret. This pattern is consistent with prior reports that rectification benefits are context dependent: strongest in threshold-and-lag aligned regimes, and more mixed when data-generating structure is less compatible with the assumed critical-range mechanism.
- Chapter: `Theoretical Analysis (RQ2)`; Section: `Chapter context (no explicit section)`; Line: `Chapters/06_rq2.tex:5`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that RQ2 asks why rectification helps and how broadly that mechanism can be generalized. This chapter provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) theoretical justification for the binarization step using the irrepresentable condition (IC) as the central lens. The analysis is intentionally scoped: it focuses on zero-threshold sign binarization under joint normal feature assumptions, where correlation behavior is analytically tractable.
- Chapter: `Theoretical Analysis (RQ2)`; Section: `Chapter context (no explicit section)`; Line: `Chapters/06_rq2.tex:7`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that The point of this chapter is not to claim a universal theorem for every thresholding scheme. Instead, it establishes a defensible mechanism: if binarization contracts dependence in the right way, the IC becomes easier to satisfy, and sparse support recovery becomes more likely. That mechanism aligns with both prior empirical evidence in this line of inquiry and broader observations that lasso-style selection can be unstable under strong dependence.
- Chapter: `Theoretical Analysis (RQ2)`; Section: `PoC setup and assumptions`; Line: `Chapters/06_rq2.tex:34`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that To keep the analysis explicit, this chapter uses the PoC setting from prior work.
- Chapter: `Theoretical Analysis (RQ2)`; Section: `Why sign binarization can reduce dependence`; Line: `Chapters/06_rq2.tex:71`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that The second point should not be read as a universal monotone guarantee for every design. It is a regime-level effect supported in the PoC analysis and tied to matrix-conditioning arguments.
- Chapter: `Theoretical Analysis (RQ2)`; Section: `Practical interpretation`; Line: `Chapters/06_rq2.tex:150`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that This interpretation connects theory to observed outcomes in earlier chapters: fewer false positives, clearer lag attribution, and higher support stability in threshold-and-lag aligned datasets.
- Chapter: `Theoretical Analysis (RQ2)`; Section: `What this theorem does not claim`; Line: `Chapters/06_rq2.tex:185`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that These caveats are consistent with prior reports that transformed and untransformed tradeoffs can vary by regime, with some datasets favoring raw discrimination while transformed models improve interpretability and attribution fidelity.
- Chapter: `Anytime Rule Compression (RQ3)`; Section: `Chapter context (no explicit section)`; Line: `Chapters/07_rq3.tex:5`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that Research Question 3 asks whether a sparse, rectified linear model can be compressed into a compact rule form while preserving practical discrimination quality. In this dissertation, the target is not just sparsity in coefficient space, but operational interpretability: a model that can be read, explained, and validated as an explicit decision rule under realistic constraints. The anytime rule compression framework was proposed to address this requirement by converting a fitted sparse model into an ordered sequence of candidate logic rules and allowing compression to stop as soon as performance is good enough for the application context.
- Chapter: `Anytime Rule Compression (RQ3)`; Section: `Why RQ3 Matters After RQ1 and RQ2`; Line: `Chapters/07_rq3.tex:9`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that RQ1 and RQ2 establish two foundations: first, binarization plus sparse learning can recover relevant structure more reliably in threshold-driven settings; second, the theoretical conditions for support recovery can improve when feature interactions are reframed through the binarized representation. RQ3 addresses the remaining translational gap: whether those improvements can be turned into human-auditable, low-complexity rules without giving back the predictive benefit.
- Chapter: `Anytime Rule Compression (RQ3)`; Section: `Relationship to Adjacent Interpretable Methods`; Line: `Chapters/07_rq3.tex:82`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that The approach is also related to Logical Analysis of Data (LAD), particularly in its use of thresholded indicators and logical structure, but it targets a different optimization path and deployment interface .

- Chapter: `Anytime Rule Compression (RQ3)`; Section: `Interim Answer to RQ3`; Line: `Chapters/07_rq3.tex:101`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that The accumulated evidence supports a positive interim answer: sparse rectified models can often be compressed into substantially smaller -of- rule representations with little practical degradation in discrimination, while improving interpretability and deployability. The key contribution is the anytime formulation itself: it makes compression controllable, auditable, and explicitly tied to operational tolerances rather than fixed model-size heuristics.
- Chapter: `Future Work`; Section: `Chapter context (no explicit section)`; Line: `Chapters/88_futurework.tex:5`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that This chapter defines the work that must be completed before the final formal dissertation defense. The goal is not to introduce a new research direction, but to close remaining validity gaps in a controlled, auditable way and convert the current proof-of-concept contributions into a defense-ready body of evidence. The plan extends the method lineage established in prior work while preserving the same three-stage architecture: critical-range rectification, sparse fitting, and anytime rule compression.

- Chapter: `Conclusion`; Section: `Chapter context (no explicit section)`; Line: `Chapters/89_conclusion.tex:5`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that This dissertation examined longitudinal feature learning under three simultaneous constraints: dependence induced by lag expansion, the need for reliable feature-lag attribution, and the requirement for compact, human-auditable model outputs. The central claim is that a representation-first pipeline, followed by sparse fitting and anytime rule compression, provides a practical middle ground between unstable raw sparse selection and computationally heavy direct rule search.
- Chapter: `Conclusion`; Section: `Conclusions by Research Question > RQ1 conclusion: Rectification can improve attribution reliability in target regimes`; Line: `Chapters/89_conclusion.tex:22`; Relevance: Cited to support the statement that The accumulated evidence supports a conditional positive conclusion for RQ1. In threshold-and-lag aligned settings, critical-range rectification tends to improve support concentration, lag localization, and sparse-model usability under multicollinearity stress . This finding is consistent with known dependence-related limits of penalty-only sparse selection, where prediction can remain acceptable while support identification degrades.

The theoretical contribution is therefore mechanistic rather than universal.
