# Relations Between Two Sets of Variates (Hotelling, 1936)

## Dissertation Alignment Context
The dissertation proposal uses a three-stage longitudinal pipeline: critical-range rectification of lagged signals into {-1,+1} indicators, L1-regularized logistic feature-and-lag selection, and anytime rule compression that converts sparse coefficients into compact m-of-K rules.

## Outline Summary of the Paper
1. **Problem statement and motivation (Section 1):** Hotelling formalizes how to study dependence between *two sets* of variables (vector-valued variates), not just pairwise scalar correlations.
2. **Algebraic setup (Section 2):** The paper develops determinant and matrix tools needed to express cross-set relationships in invariant form under linear transformations.
3. **Canonical variates and canonical correlations (Section 3):** It derives linear combinations of each variable set that maximize cross-set correlation pairwise, introducing canonical variates and ordered canonical correlations.
4. **Global dependence measures (Section 4):** It defines vector correlation and alienation coefficients as set-level summaries, and connects them analytically to products/functions of canonical correlations.
5. **Sampling variability (Section 5):** The paper develops standard-error approximations for sample canonical correlations and related quantities.
6. **Computation and worked examples (Section 6):** It provides numerical examples and an iterative solution strategy for practical calculation in finite samples.
7. **Geometric/product interpretations (Section 7):** It shows how vector correlation can be represented as products of ordinary correlations or cosines, clarifying geometric structure.
8. **Distribution theory (Sections 8-10):** Exact and approximate sampling distributions for the vector-correlation statistic are derived, including large- and small-sample behavior.
9. **Hypothesis testing and special cases (Sections 11-15):** The paper develops tests for complete independence between sets and analyzes special low-dimensional cases with explicit bivariate distributions.
10. **Open problems and extensions (Section 16):** It closes with unresolved issues and further directions, especially around inference in more complex dependence structures.

## Relevance to the Dissertation
