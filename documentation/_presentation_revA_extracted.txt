01.
Background
The core problem and knowledge gap.

===== Slide 4 (ppt/slides/slide4.xml) =====
CoreProblem
Two tensions:
correlation + high dimension → unstable sparse selection
interpretability demands rules, not hundreds of coefficients.
Real World
Longitudinal sensor/clinical/industrial signals often reflect threshold behavior and lagged dependencies, which complicates creation of interpretable models.

===== Slide 5 (ppt/slides/slide5.xml) =====
KnowledgeGap
Existing sparse methods become unstable under correlated lag features, existing rule learners are costly, and black boxes aren’t usable in constrained compute environments or in areas where interpretability is more important than simple accuracy.
Accurate, Interpretable, Sparse, Efficient

===== Slide 6 (ppt/slides/slide6.xml) =====
OtherSolutions
There are several competing solutions to these problems, but they each have shortcomings that limit their usefulness.  Note that deep learning solutions were as a rule not considered as “competing” methods this work focuses on inherently interpretable sparse models with explicit feature attribution under constrained compute.
Group and structured sparsity
These impose some kind of structure on the coefficients, preserve domain groupings, and stabilize estimation, but remain sensitive to near singular covariance.
Rank based LASSO
These can be advantageous in specific regimes but ultimately leave the original covariance geometry intact, affecting both sparsity and accuracy.
Wrapper methods
These pragmatically prune the data using less transparent heuristics and complex dependencies, often making the answers difficult to understand.
Quadratic programming and logic rules
These are perhaps the closest and produce a similar result but are computationally intensive and tend to focus on pairwise testing and combinatorial rule searches.

===== Slide 9 (ppt/slides/slide9.xml) =====
Critical Range
A critical range describes a condition in which an event has a non-zero chance of occurring. In its simplest manifestation for independent variables, it is a min and max describing all times in which that event has ever occurred, but may be a more complex association if variables are not independent.  In short, rectification turns continuous, correlated signals into logical indicators.

Measuring Success
The goal of this work is to create a system for modeling that produces easily interpretable rules but still describes the phenomenon as well or nearly as well as the best alternate solution.  The metrics we used are selected to be as descriptive and non-biased as possible:
Predictive and Interpretable
Performance:
Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)
Youden’s J-Index (notable for its use in imbalanced data sets)
Interpretability:
Number of Features / Rules (minimized)
Efficiency:
Training / Inference Runtime

===== Slide 11 (ppt/slides/slide11.xml) =====
Research Questions
Selecting relevant features in high-dimensional, strongly correlated longitudinal data is challenging when go/no-go thresholds and lags drive outcomes.  Many physical phenomena (e.g. brittle fracture) and psychological outcomes are governed by such rules. We use binarization to map continuous measurements to binary indicators defined by critical ranges, simplifying correlations and stabilizing sparse model fitting. This motivation begs the following research questions:
Motivation
RQ1
Can critical-range binarization produce a stable sparse baseline with reliable feature attribution?
RQ2
Why does binarization work, and can the backbone be generalized?
RQ3
Can the solution be compressed into a set of logical rules?

===== Slide 12 (ppt/slides/slide12.xml) =====
02a.
Research Question #1
Can critical-range binarization produce a stable sparse baseline with reliable feature attribution?

===== Slide 13 (ppt/slides/slide13.xml) =====
RQ1: Rectification Step
Collect and Flatten Longitudinal Data
Lagged examples are collected for each event with each column of data offset by one time step for each measurement.  This is the origin of the problem of highly correlated measurements.
All measurements taken when the response vector is “TRUE” are by definition within the critical range.
Critical Range Determination

===== Slide 14 (ppt/slides/slide14.xml) =====
RQ1: Synthetic Data
Compare Coefficients between Transformed vs. Untransformed Data
Simply performing the critical range transformation on the synthetic input data showed remarkable adherence to the known relevant feature selection.  Synthetic data was used first to compare actual results with known relevant features using complete data.

===== Slide 15 (ppt/slides/slide15.xml) =====
RQ1: Quadratic Programming Comparison
The closest parallel method
In addition to being imprecise with respect to the specific relevant variables and time-steps, the computational intensity of that method was far in excess of the method
described in this work. The slowdown was variable, but the Katrutsa and Strijov method was generally about 100 to 200 times slower than the combined time requirement of the data transformation and LASSO fit together.
Using the method pioneered by Katrutsa and Strijov
Note that this gives coefficient values for “importance” but does not produce a model to measure other metrics (e.g. AUC, Youden’s J-Index, F1, etc.)
Many of the importance values came close to identifying the correct variables, but in many cases identified the wrong time-step.
The data is the same between last slide and this one.

===== Slide 16 (ppt/slides/slide16.xml) =====
RQ1: Real World Data
Compare Coefficients between Transformed vs. Untransformed Data
The coefficients correctly identified the correct features (the turbine instrument) in this case and excluded other features which were not relevant. Note that while the basic metrics of the UNICEF data set were superior for the un-transformed data, the complexity of the solution was much greater (5 vs. 16 feature categories).

===== Slide 17 (ppt/slides/slide17.xml) =====
RQ1: Takeaway
Bonus advantage
The binarization process also reduces computational demands compared to untransformed data. Model fitting with transformed data is nearly twice as fast, even including transformation time. The linear time transformation supports parallelism for large datasets and potentially could benefit from faster integer math. Thus, transforming data prior to fitting can also improve efficiency.
The binarization method effectively shifts the frame of reference to boolean logic,
providing an alternative to traditional additive models. It leverages the LASSO algorithm
to identify optimal logical combinations with a sparse coefficient vector, useful
as a feature selection tool beyond just classification. It also identifies critical ranges
for continuous variables, offering additional insights to adjust variables and influence
studied processes. Any problems that can be formulated as binary classifications can
potentially benefit from this approach.

RQ2: Irrepresentable Condition (IC)
A Tractable Proof-of-Concept (POC)
While nonzero thresholds obey a related but more intricate mapping, the full proof of such a relationship would be far more complex and would not be necessary to show the broad strokes of why binarization helps.  However, such an effort might be beneficial for teasing out additional applications or how the method might be useful in the future.  As a result, further work along these lines is recommended going forward.
Based on the work of Zhao and Yu in 2006, which proved that if we can satisfy the IC relationship, there is a substantially improved probability of recovering the true support for a dataset.
We will use the arcsin relation as a tractable proof‑of‑concept (PoC) to show that in the case of zero-based thresholds binarization increases the probability of satisfying the IC.
High collinearity among raw, lag‑expanded features often violates the IC, yielding dense or unstable selections, hence the focus in this work on longitudinal data.
We are attempting to prove that the probability of the following relationship holding true:
is greater if binarization is used to transform the data set.

However, such an effort might be beneficial for teasing out additional applications or how the method might be useful in the future.

For standardized, jointly normal (𝑋, 𝑌) with correlation 𝜌 and binarized 𝑋.
The tilde (“~”) is used to distinguish binarized data from its original continuous counterpart, where in this case all feature values greater than 0 are coded as +1 and all feature values that are less than or equal to zero are coded as -1.
Under joint normality and zero-threshold sign binarization, this result shows that when binarized, all pairwise correlations must be less than or equal to their original, never greater.
In fact, equality occurs only at 𝜌∈{−1,0,1}, due to the arcsin relation being strictly convex on (0,1) and strictly concave on (-1,0).
The bivariate normal orthant probability identity, 𝑃(𝑋 > 0, 𝑌 > 0) = 1⁄4 + 1⁄2𝜋 arcsin(𝜌) implies the following closed-form mapping:

Similar expressions for binarized versions  and  and can be expressed by substituting  for .
When the expression  is true, it can be shown that:
The gram matrix  is expressed as  and its inverse as   in the following equi-correlated case assuming 𝜌∈(−1/(𝑠−1),1) so that 𝐺 is invertible:
where,  is the identity matrix of size S, and  is a matrix of ones of size S.
Thus, binarization will consistently emphasize positive correlation relationships by reducing the infinity norm of the inverse gram matrix. Recall that this is the second term in the IC:

The infinity norm of  will always be 1 when limiting consideration to non-zero coefficients.
It can be shown that for non-relevant features  and relevant features , the magnitude of the covariance decreases under binarization using the arcsin relation previously covered under the simplifications stated.
Because  for , binarization attenuates positive correlations; the attenuation factor is strongest away from , leading to a proportionately greater effect for non-relevant features.
So with these assumptions, , often strictly smaller for

Thus, under the stated assumptions:
The lemmas isolate why binarization helps:
pairwise contraction keeps off‑diagonals from saturating
better conditioning bounds inverse norms
Smaller off‑support covariances reduce the IC term.
Together these raise the chance of correct support recovery and promote sparse, stable selections.

Research Question #3
Can the solution be compressed into a set of logical rules?

===== Slide 25 (ppt/slides/slide25.xml) =====
RQ3: Rule Compression
“Logic Polishing”
We will use the term “logic polishing” to describe the process of taking the focused results of the L1-logistic and cleaning up the smaller magnitude coefficients by forcing the coefficients to be either a specific large value or zero. The specific value chosen can be adjusted, but experiments have shown that there is very little difference in the outcome as long as the chosen coefficient is sufficiently larger than the noisy coefficients we are attempting to force to zero.
L1-regularized logistic models provide:
Sparsity
Computational simplicity
But there are still potentially large numbers of small magnitude weights that obscure underlying logic.  The example to the right shows the value that each step in the process provides.
Rectification focuses the model on the appropriate features
Rule compression cleans the result and produces a logical model

===== Slide 26 (ppt/slides/slide26.xml) =====
RQ3: Results
Paired t-test AUC P-value comparison
The Youden’s J vs K plot shows the number of features required to achieve the specific result.
The procedure shows a clear progression, which will allow the model to stop once the desired metric value has been reached.
Adding more features than is required forces the result to zero in this case since irrelevant features will not be in sync with the other features (a hallmark of spurious correlators).

Critical-range rectification yields more reliable feature/lag attribution in longitudinal, correlated settings (synthetic + real-world).
Often improves interpretability and efficiency (fewer feature categories; faster fits).
Proof-of-concept shows binarization can increase the probability of satisfying IC under tractable assumptions.
Key mechanism: correlation contraction + improved conditioning → smaller off-support influence.
“Logic polishing” compresses sparse models into compact rule forms without materially degrading AUC / J (equivalence framing).
Anytime behavior: stop once desired J reached (complexity-performance tradeoff).
The final result of the analysis will be an interpretable sparse baseline, theoretical justification, and usable rule model.
